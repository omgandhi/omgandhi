### ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Om. 

I'm a first-year student at the University of Waterloo who's most interested in software development. I started coding several years ago with a simple "Hello world!" webpage, and have since completed a bunch of online courses on topics such as Python, data science, and React, built several side projects, and accumulated ~2 years of work experience. 

Have a look at my [personal website](https://omgandhi.com/) to learn more about me.
